## Why MySQL?

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) was chosen as the database because it is a simple relational database. It provides what most of the relational databases provide and nothing more. Part of the reason why [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) was chosen is [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).

With [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio), you can see the database in a GUI.

### Prisma Studio

[Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) is a GUI for the database. It is also used to manage the database. You can find more information about [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-studio).
